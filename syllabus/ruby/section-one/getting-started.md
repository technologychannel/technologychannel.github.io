# Getting Started with Ruby language

To get Ruby into your system, you need to first install it and there are several ways and/or tools to do it. This
page describes how to install Ruby in Linux, macOS or Windows. There are many ways to install Ruby in each
operating systems. I have listed following ways which I would recommend.

## Install Ruby in Linux

The most recommended way to install Ruby in Linux is through [RVM][rvm-link]{:target="_blank"}.
Although, each operating system has their own package manager through which you can install Ruby.
Like using `apt` in Ubuntu as
```
sudo apt-get install ruby-full
```

However, RVM helps in managing multiple Ruby versions. It means you can switch between many versions through RVM.
It is required while working in many projects having different Ruby versions.

### Install GPG keys

As a first step, install GPG keys used to verify installation package:

```
gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB
```

### Install RVM stable with Ruby:

Then, run following command to get the latest stable version Ruby.

```
\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
```

For more information, proceed to [RVM website][rvm-link]{:target="_blank"}.

## Install Ruby in Windows

The easiest way to install Ruby in Windows is through [RubyInstaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/){:target="_blank"}.
This is a self-contained Windows-based installer that includes the Ruby language, an execution environment,
important documentation, and more.

Just download the _RubyInstaller_ binary and run it to install like a normal windows software.

## Install Ruby in macOS

The recommended way to install Ruby in macOS is through [RVM][rvm-link]{:target="_blank"}.
Follow the steps mentioned in [`Install Ruby in Linux`](#install-ruby-in-linux) section.

Although, if you want to use native package manager, you can also install Ruby through `brew` as
```
brew install ruby
```

## NOTES

Check [Ruby installation documentation](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/){:target="_blank"}
page to see different ways to install Ruby for different platforms.
