Ruby is an **interpreted**, **high-level**, and **general-purpose** programming language.
It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by `Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto` in Japan.

Ruby is **dynamically typed** and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural,
object-oriented, and functional programming.

Its creator, Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto has often said that he is _"trying to make Ruby natural, not simple,"_ in a
way that mirrors life.

>> Ruby community: "Matz is nice and so we are nice," commonly abbreviated as MINASWAN.

Let’s understand the important features of the language briefly reviewed
below.

### Interpreted

An interpreted language is a type of programming language for which most of its implementations execute
instructions directly and freely, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions. The
interpreter executes the program directly, translating each statement into a sequence of one or more subroutines,
and then into another language (often machine code).

### High Level

High-level language refers to the higher level of abstraction from machine language. Rather than dealing with
registers, memory addresses and call stacks, high-level languages deal with variables, arrays, objects, complex
arithmetic or boolean expressions, subroutines and functions, loops, threads, locks, and other abstract computer
science concepts, with a focus on usability over optimal program efficiency.

### General Purpose

Designed to be used for writing software in the widest variety of application domains. Conversely, a
domain-specific programming language is one designed to be used within a specific application domain.

### Dynamically Typed

The type is associated with run-time values, and not named variables/fields etc. This means that a programmer can
write a need not have to specify types every time. Conversely, type of a variable is known at compile time for a
Statically Typed.

```ruby
name = 'Ruby'
# variable name is given data type as String by Ruby Interpreter

name = 100
# variable name data type is changed to Integer by Ruby Interpreter
```

In above example, you can easily understand how the data type of the variable `name` can be switched easily
since during compile time data type is not checked.

#### Garbage Collection

In computer science, garbage collection (GC) is a form of automatic memory management. The garbage collector, or
just collector, attempts to reclaim garbage, or memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use by the
program.

Check [this article](https://ruby-hacking-guide.github.io/gc.html){:target="_blank"} to understand the whole
concept, design, type and process of garbage collection in Ruby in details.

The strategies of Garbage collection has evolved from Mark & Sweep to Incremental Sweep in Ruby 2.2. More can be
found [here](https://blog.heroku.com/incremental-gc).

## Philosophy of Ruby

In an interview Matz discussed the _Philosophy of Ruby_ where he described why he designed Ruby.

### No Perfect Language

Matz says, "Instead of emphasizing the what, I want to emphasize the how part: how
we feel while programming. That's Ruby's main difference from other
language designs. I emphasize the feeling, in particular, how I feel
using Ruby. I didn't work hard to make Ruby perfect for everyone,
because you feel differently from me. No language can be perfect for
everyone. I tried to make Ruby perfect for me, but maybe it's not
perfect for you.

### Freedom and Comfort

Matz says, "Ruby inherited the Perl philosophy of having more than one way to do
the same thing. I want to make Ruby users free. I want to give them the
freedom to choose. People are different. People choose different
criteria. But if there is a better way among many alternatives, I want
to encourage that way by making it comfortable."

### The Joy of Ruby

Matz says, "You want to enjoy life, don't you? If you get your job done quickly and
your job is fun, that's good isn't it?  That's the purpose of life,
partly. Your life is better.  I want to solve problems I meet in the
daily life by using computers, so I need to write programs."

### The Human Factor

Matz says, "Often people, especially computer engineers, focus on the machines.
They think, "By doing this, the machine will run faster. By doing
this, the machine will run more effectively. By doing this, the
machine will something something something." They are focusing on
machines. But in fact we need to focus on humans, on how humans care
about doing programming or operating the application of the machines.
We are the masters. They are the slaves."

### Principle of Least Surprise

Matz says, "The principle of least surprise means principle of least my surprise.
And it means the principle of least surprise after you learn Ruby very
well. For example, I was a C++ programmer before I started designing
Ruby. I programmed in C++ exclusively for two or three years. And after
two years of C++ programming, it still surprised me."
