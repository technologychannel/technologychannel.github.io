# Getting input from User in Ruby language

Sometimes during the program you want ask user to interact with the program like
asking his name or other details.

This can be easily achieved by Ruby `gets` method which is opposite of `puts` which print the output
to standard output device i.e monitor.

In Ruby, we can get user input like this:

```ruby
puts "Enter your name: "
name = gets.chomp
puts "Hello #{name}, how are you"

# output
Enter your name:
RubyGuru
Hello, RubyGuru, how are you
```

{% include util/note.html
    note="The reason for using 'chomp' after 'gets' is that 'gets' will read the data entered by
user and store into variable 'name' along with new line char '\n'. The method 'chomp' will remove
the trailing new line char and store only entered data into 'name'."
%}

```ruby
puts "Enter your name: "
name = gets
puts "Hello #{name}, how are you"

# output
Enter your name:
RubyGuru
Hello, RubyGuru
, how are you     # new line effect
```

## Extended example

In the following example, I have extended the use of `gets` to accept other details of person
and transforming the data into appropriate variables.

```ruby
print "Enter your name: "
name = gets.chomp
print "Enter your age: "
age = gets.to_i
print "Enter your address: "
addr = gets.chomp

puts "Hello, #{name}, how are you"
puts "If I am right, your age is '#{age}'"
puts "And, your address is '#{addr}', right?"

# output
Enter your name: foo
Enter your age: 10
Enter your address: barpak, gorkha, Nepal
Hello, foo, how are you
If I am right, your age is '10'
And, your address is 'barpak, gorkha, Nepal', right?
```

### NOTE

- `to_i` is used to convert the numeric string to integer.
- `print` is used to ask information because `puts` will add new line char and give a
  feeling that you are entering your data in another line.

## Calculator

Let's build a small calculator program in Ruby. Here, we ask user two numbers and then print the
addition of it.

```ruby
print "Enter first number: "
num1 = gets.to_f

print "Enter second number: "
num2 = gets.to_f

puts "#{num1} + #{num2} = #{num1 + num2}"
```

{% include util/show-output.html id="calc" caption="Output" %}
{% include util/output.html id="calc"
    output="Enter first number: 5\nEnter second number: 15\n5.0 + 15.0 = 20.0" lang="ruby" %}
