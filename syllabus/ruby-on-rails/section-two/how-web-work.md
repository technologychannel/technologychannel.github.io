# How does web work

The web has a different layers (Application, TCP, Internet, Session, Hardware, Presentation layers) all inter-connected.
However, it essentially work through HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol).

{% include util/quote.html
  quote="The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access, for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser." source="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol"
%}

The HTTP works in a _request—response_ cycle in the _client—server_ model.
